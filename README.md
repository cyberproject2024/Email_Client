## Email_Client
This is the CyberSec FSO Discord group project of creating an email client. 
We will be working towards this on our own time and having a weekly meeting to go over updates and potential changes.

To show how github Desktop works I have a task for everyone to complete.

Step 1: find your name below and delete it. (Your name is intentionally misspelled or incomplete to not dox anybody.)
Step 2: create a new line where your name was and type "github"
Step 3: save this file
Step 4: open github desktop and view the changes made to the file. (Take note of colors that indicate changes.)

Once everyone has done this I will change the README File to reflect information on the project.
